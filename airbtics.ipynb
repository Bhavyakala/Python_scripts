    " - Amenities like A.C, wifi, TV, pool etc.\n",
    " - No. of bedrooms\n",
    " - No. of bathrooms\n",

    " - Cleaning fee\n",
    " - Cancellation policy\n",
    " - Service fee\n",
    " - No. of reviews\n",
    " - Availability\n",
    " - No. of postive/negative reviews \n",
    " - occupancy\n",
    " - price per ni\n",
    " \n",
    "Location - Depends wether the person is comfortable with that location or it is a healthy/clean locality. <br>\n",
    "Amenities - Different people have different requirements so if they find more amenities then they are likely occupy it. <br>\n",
    "Cleaning fee - people like to stay in clean property but at the same time the cleaning fee should be affordable. <br>\n",
    "Cancellation policy - for people who have more possibility of cancellation such as frequent travellers would like to have a good deal. <br>\n",
    "Availability - property should be available for accomodation most of the time that is it should not be under construction or maintanence also                availability rate over a span of few days could hel pin predicting the occupancy rate of upcoming days. <br>\n",
    "Reviews - Play a vital factor in occupancy rate as any person who will see a property firsts checks out reviews and makes a decision on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting data of this over some time we can find a pattern and anomalies for occupancy rate increment and decrement and find the reason behind it. First I will start with sentiment analysis of reviews and categorize them into postive/negative reviews as reviews tells us the state of the property and helps us predict occupancy rate and hence revenue. all the above parameters can be fed into a machine learning and deep learning model to predict occupancy rate and we can then get revenue generated for that year using occupancy rate and the price of the property.\n",
